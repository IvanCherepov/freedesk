Though we would start out small, we'd probably end up in a 125 or 250 repositories price range.\n\nWe have a couple of questions, though.\n\n1. We require that online providers encrypt in transit and at rest. Do you have a SOC letter that asserts this?\n\n2. We require that online providers have an export function, which allows us to export our data for separate storage. How is that done with quay?\n\nWe've looked at on-prem installation: its probably too pricey for us, plus we would rather not manage the stuff ourselves.\n\nThanks for your time!\nDave","status":"closed","recipient":"support@quay.io","requester_id":7350313227,"submitter_id":7350313227,"assignee_id":1483048988,"group_id":26088747,"tags":["hosted","quay","quay_hosted","upsell"],"brand_id":367997,"created_at":"2016-06-23T20:02:48Z","updated_at":"2016-07-09T22:01:14Z"}}
